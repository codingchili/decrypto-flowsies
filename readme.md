# decrypto-flowsies

The project has two parts, the analyzer and the generator. The generator generates network traffic
by loading web pages and the analyzer captures the network traffic, labels datasets and trains the model. The analyzer is implemented in Python (3.8+) and
the generator in nodejs (16+), these are required in order to run. See documentation for each part
on how to install application dependencies.

The goal of the project is to build machine learning models usable on TLS encrypted websites. The model
should be able to distinguish pages within a site to break privacy and infer information about the user. As an example,
a user browses a health information site and reads about rare disease X - the model should then be able
to classify the flow and match it to the webpage describing disease X. 

It is not a primary interest to distinguish websites from eachother, because this is much easier, already leaks
in multiple ways, and doesn't break privacy to the same degree. As a result of the analysis, certain key characteristics
that makes sites easy to analyze is identified.

### Limitations

This is the authors first project considering machine learning so information might be incorrect, the approach inefficient etc. The 
project is nevertheless published here. In order for the project to see some success, limitations are as follows,

* Analyzes a single ciphersuite per site.
* Evaluate a limited number of features.
* Use of limited/ineffective/simple learning algorithms.
* Latency/jitter is not considered, LAN analysis only.
* Flows are generated by a single client (generator).
* The model is only trained for a single browser, Chrome.

### Ethical & Legal considerations

* Ensure that user consent has been explicitly given when capturing live data.
* Prefer to mirror websites and serve them locally on LAN for training.
* Ensure proper delay between site loads when testing against online sites.
* Limit the number of requests that is performed for online sites.

## Traffic analyzer

Implements the following features

* collects network traffic based on a given filter.
* communicates with the generator to label traffic.
* saves/loads traffic datasets in json.
* generates dataset visualisations.
* trains the machine learning model. (tbd)
* performs classification of traffic as it is analyzed. (tbd)
* notifies the generator when it's running in monitor mode. (tbd)

To install requirements run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

The analyzer uses `asyncio`, `pandas` and `scapy`.

from `./` run, 
```
$ python -m analyzer.run -h
usage: run.py [-h] [--interface INTERFACE] [--ip IP] [--ports [PORTS]] [--address [ADDRESS]] [--dump [DUMP]] [--load LOAD] [--eth]

Traffic analyzer.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --interface INTERFACE
                        interface to listen on.
  --ip IP               host to capture traffic from/to.
  --ports [PORTS]       ports to capture traffic on.
  --address [ADDRESS]   location of shared directory.
  --dump [DUMP]         dump all data under the given ./data dir.
  --load LOAD           loads the dump with the given name.
  --eth                 lists the available interfaces.

```

run example,

```
python -m analyzer.run --interface "Ethernet" --ip "192.168.0.114" --port 2180,1922 --dump dataset_1
```

output sample,

```javascript
2022-03-29 09:48:52,050 listening notifications in './bus/analyzer.bus'.
2022-03-29 09:48:52,050 started capture on 'Realtek RTL8822CE 802.11ac PCIe Adapter'
2022-03-29 09:48:52,050 using filter 'host 192.168.0.114 and port (2180 or 1922)'..

2022-03-29 09:42:54,512 capture in progress [packets = 192]
```

## Traffic generator
Implements the following features

* generates network traffic by loading webpages using puppeteer/chrome.
* notifies the analyzer which site is being loaded for labeling.
* when a flow is classified, load the page. (monitor mode). (tbd)
* create clones of websites for testing locally.
* includes a mDNS beacon for hostname simulation.

To install dependencies, run `npm install` in `./generator`.

from `./generator` run,
```
$ node index.js -h
usage: index.js [-h] [-v] [--monitor] [--generate] [-l] [-s NAME] [-b DIR] [-c NUM] [-d SEC] [--web [BIND]] [-p PORT] [-r DIR] [-i] [--forge URL] [-o NAME] [-f NUM] [-m] [--beacon NAME] [--ip ADDR]

Dataset generator and real-time monitoring of analyzer.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version

Monitor and replay network traffic in real time using the analyzer:
  --monitor             monitor replay, requires a running analyzer.

Generate web traffic for the analyzers sniffer module:
  --generate            generate data, requires a running analyzer.
  -l, --list            list available sites.
  -s NAME, --site NAME  select sites to requests, separated by comma.
  -b DIR, --bus DIR     location for the message bus dir.
  -c NUM, --count NUM   number of page loads to generate.
  -d SEC, --delay SEC   pause between page loads

Serve static websites that the generator can target:
  --web [BIND]          bind webserver to given hostname.
  -p PORT, --port PORT  port to run the webserver to.
  -r DIR, --res DIR     directory to serve resources from.
  -i , --inject         javascript file to inject into html heads.

Create a static copy of a remote website for the webserver:
  --forge URL           create a mock clone of the given site.
  -o NAME, --out NAME   name of web folder to store site in.
  -f NUM, --follow NUM  depth of a-href links to follow. (0)
  -m, --missing         attempt to clone the 404 page.

Multicast DNS beacon for hostname simulation.:
  --beacon NAME         Runs a mDNS beacon to announce the given host.
  --ip ADDR             the host ip of the mDNS response.

```

run example,

```
node main -g -d 0 -r 1500 -s mutable -c
```

output sample,

```javascript
