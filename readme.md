# decrypto-flowsies

The project has two parts, the analyzer and the generator. The generator generates network traffic
by loading web pages and the analyzer captures the network traffic, labels datasets and trains the model. The analyzer is implemented in Python (3.8+) and
the generator in nodejs (16+), these are required in order to run. See documentation for each part
on how to install application dependencies.

The goal of the project is to build machine learning models usable on TLS encrypted websites. The model
should be able to distinguish pages within a site to break privacy and infer information about the user. As an example,
a user browses a health information site and reads about rare disease X - the model should then be able
to classify the flow and match it to the webpage describing disease X. 

It is not a primary interest to distinguish websites from eachother, because this is much easier, already leaks
in multiple ways, and doesn't break privacy to the same degree. As a result of the analysis, certain key characteristics
that makes sites easy to analyze is identified.

### Limitations

This is the authors first project considering machine learning so information might be incorrect, the approach inefficient etc. The 
project is nevertheless published here. In order for the project to see some success, limitations are as follows,

* Analyzes a single ciphersuite per site.
* Evaluate a limited number of features.
* Use of limited/ineffective/simple learning algorithms.
* Latency/jitter is not considered, LAN analysis only.
* Flows are generated by a single client (generator).
* The model is only trained for a single browser, Chrome.

### Ethical & Legal considerations

* Ensure that user consent has been explicitly given when capturing live data.
* Prefer to mirror websites and serve them locally on LAN for training.
* Ensure proper delay between site loads when testing against online sites.
* Limit the number of requests that is performed for online sites.

## Traffic analyzer

Implements the following features

* collects network traffic based on a given filter.
* communicates with the generator to label traffic.
* saves/loads traffic datasets in json.
* generates dataset visualisations.
* trains the machine learning model. (tbd)
* performs classification of traffic as it is analyzed. (tbd)
* notifies the generator when it's running in monitor mode. (tbd)

To install requirements run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

The analyzer uses `asyncio`, `pandas` and `scapy`.

from `./` run, 
```
$ ./analyze -h
usage: -c [-h] {list,sniff,plot,learn,monitor} ...

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

Traffic analyzer:
  Available commands

  {list,sniff,plot,learn,monitor}
    list                lists the available interfaces
    sniff               capture network data to create data sets.
    plot                create plots of the given data set.
    learn               train a new model using the given data set.
    monitor             monitor traffic using the given model.
```

run example,

```
./analyze sniff --ip 192.168.0.149 --ports 443 --dump dataset_1 eno1
```

output sample,

```javascript
2022-05-04 11:35:29,357 started capture on 'eno1'
2022-05-04 11:35:29,357 using filter 'ip and host 192.168.0.149 and port (443)'..
2022-05-04 11:35:29,359 listening on '127.0.0.1:9555' and publishing on '224.0.0.14:9555'.
2022-03-29 09:48:52,050 capture in progress [packets = 0]
2022-03-29 09:42:53,815 sniffer collecting by label 'https://192.168.0.114/login' ..
2022-03-29 09:42:53,999 capture in progress [packets = 167]
2022-03-29 09:42:54,512 capture in progress [packets = 192]
```

## Traffic generator
Implements the following features

* generates network traffic by loading webpages using puppeteer/chrome.
* notifies the analyzer which site is being loaded for labeling.
* when a flow is classified, load the page. (monitor mode). (tbd)
* create clones of websites for testing locally.
* includes a mDNS beacon for hostname simulation.

To install dependencies, run `npm install` in `./generator`.

from `./generator` run,
```
$ ./generate -h
usage: index.js [-v] {forge,serve,sites,site,beacon,monitor} ...

Dataset generator and real-time monitoring of analyzer.

optional arguments:
  -v, --version

Available commands:
  {forge,serve,sites,site,beacon,monitor}
    forge               Create a static copy of a remote website for the webserver
    serve               Serve static websites that the generator can target
    sites               list available sites.
    site                Generate web traffic for the analyzers sniffer module
    beacon              Multicast DNS beacon for hostname simulation
    monitor             monitor replay, requires a running analyzer.
```

run example,

```
./generate site testsite -d 0 -n 128 -c
```

output sample,

```javascript
